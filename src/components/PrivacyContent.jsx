        Asan Pay Electronic Money Institution ("Asan Pay," "we," "us," or "our") is dedicated to safeguarding your privacy and managing your personal data with care. This Data Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines how we gather, utilize, share, and protect your information when you download the Asan Pay Mobile App (the "Asan Pay"), create an account, or use our electronic wallet services ("Services") in Afghanistan.

Additionally, we adhere to international best practices for financial services, such as those outlined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act principles concerning nonpublic personal information.
